            <p>The North Wind and the Sun had a quarrel about which of them was the stronger. While they were disputing with much heat and bluster, a Traveler passed along the road wrapped in a cloak. "Let us agree," said the Sun, "that he is the stronger who can strip that Traveler of his cloak."</p>

                <p>A peasant passes by and they say whoever can get him to take off his coat is stronger. The wind blew and blew but the peasant was so cold so he did not take off his coat. It wasn't until the sun came out that the peasant took his coat off. In the end kindness (the sun) wins.</p>
